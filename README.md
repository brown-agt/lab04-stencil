# CS1440/2440 Lab 4: Lemonade Stand

## Introduction
Get ready to compete in our first non-chicken game: The Lemonade Stand Game! You'll be setting up your lemonade stand, and developing an agent (either with RL or without it) using the techniques learned in the past 3 labs! This lab will be remote and much more free form. I hope you all have fun! 

## Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up your environment and install the necessary package for the lab.

**IMPORTANT: Please install/use a version of `Python >= 3.10`**
To check which version of Python you're using please run
```bash
python --version
```

If you installed Python 3.11 but your computer defaults to Python 3.9 you can initialize the virtual environment below to use 
Python 3.11 instead by running:

If you own a Mac 
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
```
Instead of 
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

If you own a Windows 
```bash
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
```

### Step 1: Git Clone the Repository 
Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to clone the repository
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/brown-agt/lab04-stencil.git
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Please then navigate to your project directory. Run the following commands to create a Python virtual environment named `.venv`.

If you own a Mac 
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you own a Windows 
```bash 
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install the agt server package
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade agt-server
```

## Agent Methods 
For the `Lemonade Agent`s here are a few methods that you may find helpful! 
- `self.calculate_utils(a1, a2, a3)` is a method that takes in player 1's action (`a1`) and player 2's action (`a2`) and player 3's action (`a3`) and returns a list [`u1`, `u2`, `u3`] where `u1` is player1's utility, `u2` is player 2's utility, and `u3` is player 2's utility. 
- `self.get_action_history()` is a method that returns a list of your actions from previous rounds played.
- `self.get_util_history()` is a method that returns a list of your utility from previous rounds played. 
- `self.get_opp1_action_history()` is a method that returns a list of your first opponents's actions from previous rounds played.
- `self.get_opp1_util_history()` is a method that returns a list of your first opponent's utility from previous rounds played.
- `self.get_opp2_action_history()` is a method that returns a list of your second opponents's actions from previous rounds played.
- `self.get_opp2_util_history()` is a method that returns a list of your second opponent's utility from previous rounds played.
- `self.get_last_action()` is a method that returns a your last action from the previous round.
- `self.get_last_util()` is a method that returns a your last utility from the previous round.
- `self.get_opp1_last_action()` is a method that returns a your first opponent's last action from the previous round.
- `self.get_opp1_last_util()` is a method that returns a your first opponent's last utility from the previous round.
- `self.get_opp2_last_action()` is a method that returns a your second opponent's last action from the previous round.
- `self.get_opp2_last_util()` is a method that returns a your second opponent's last utility from the previous round.
